Title of the project: PacMen

Description of the project: A web page which contains a PacMan factory on a blue background. Pressing "Start Game" initializes and clicking "Add PacMan" generates a new PacMan each time. The PacMen float across the screen and bounce off of the edges.

How to Run:
1: Clone the repository in its entirety using your preferred cloning method, or download as a .zip folder.
2: Extract and/or locate the downloaded files.
3: Load index.html in a web browser.
4: Click "Start Game" to initialize.
5: Click "Add PacMan" to add one PacMan, until you are content.
6: (Optional) Pressing "Start Game" after having generated PacMen will speed them up!

Roadmap of future improvements: 
To further improve this project, the pacmen could become animated to open and close their mouths. Stylizing it further to make it have a more fun look would also be an improvement.
