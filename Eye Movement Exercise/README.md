Title of the project: Eye Movement

Description of the project: This project is a web page that shows two eyes that "follow" your mouse. The background is green and the pupils are large and purple, making it look like a frog.

How to Run: 

    1: Clone the repository in its entirety using your preferred cloning method, or download as a .zip folder.
    2: Extract and/or locate the downloaded files.
    3: Load index.html in a web browser.

Roadmap of future improvements: 
In the future, I will add a custom cursor so that the mouse looks like a fly instead of a pointer.
