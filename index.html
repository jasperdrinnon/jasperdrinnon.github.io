        Bio: I started to love the internet in the early 2000s when albinoblacksheep and pixel art were popular. As a teen, I learned photoshop and HTML from tutorials, eventually competing in The Great Computer Challenge in Hampton Roads, Virginia. Later on, I learned how to synthesize music on the computer and used digital audio workstations (DAWs) and recording equipment to create sound art. Starting in 2019, I explored Python and R in my free time. Computers were more of a hobby for me until I enrolled in MITâ€™s Professional School Certificate in Web Development: Full-Stack with MERN (MongoDB, Express.JS, React .JS & Node.JS). I am located in Seattle, WA and excited to begin my new career.
